with additional features to be added later in the development.
- Jerry presents a rough draft for the game's code-wise functionality and class interactivity, 
which will later be written more formally as a guide for the team.
- The team initialises the source folder and writes the skeleton code for the game skeleton.
- As a team, 7 preliminary issues were written, with one of them being related to the skeleton code,
- which was closed during the meeting and 6 other issues related to providing functionality to the classes.


## TODO Items
- Team members will assign issues to themselves by choice and complete them
